Contribute without worry or judgement.

I created this repository as a way to teach myself and hopefully inspire others to take chances.

### Why?

I've wanted to colaborate on software before, but where do you start? How do you reach people? Are people scary?
If I don't read the documentation does that make me a bad person? Can I contribute to something and have fun?

Yes.

So can you...if you want.

I want to use this repository to make mistakes, learn, and have fun doing that! Make pull requests, give feedback,
and find new ways of thinking.

Enjoy!
